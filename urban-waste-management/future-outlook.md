# Future Outlook

The City is expected to continue producing waste at\
a consistent rate for the foreseeable future. Given that two landfills are constrained by limited airspace, there is pressure on the Urban Waste Management Directorate to implement measures that effectively divert waste.

The following trends are noted in the Urban Waste Management Directorate’s planned capital spending over the next 10 years:

* Total capital spending increases consistently for the first eight years and drops considerably thereafter due to fewer planned ‘new and upgrade’ projects in the outer years.
* A total of 98% of planned capital spending relates to ‘new and upgrade’ capital expenditure. This\
  is largely due to the capital requirements for the construction of a regional landfill site.

## Landfill

The aim is to extend the Vissershok airspace availability between 2037 and 2040. This will require a reduction in the current baseline waste consumption rate of 10,2% across the city.

In addition to the need to reduce the city’s waste consumption, landfill airspace shortages in the Stellenbosch and Drakenstein municipalities present a potential challenge as this may result in the need to use the City’s Vissershok site. This would reduce the life expectancy of this landfill. However, Stellenbosch municipality’s ability to procure additional land for their existing landfill site means that there is not an immediate threat to City landfill airspace availability from this quarter. On the other hand, airspace remains a concern for Drakenstein Municipality, where a plan to develop a waste incineration plant is being developed. These measures will only temporarily address regional capacity constraints and there is still a requirement to plan for a regional landfill site.

The City is in the process of planning for such a regional landfill site, which will provide the City with a projected 35 additional years of landfill airspace. A candidate site has been identified in Kalbaskraal and the establishment of the site is projected to cost R300 million. The process will also need to include an extensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). At the time of writing this report, the EIA for the site was in the process of submission with optimistic estimates forecasting approval in 18 months.

A significant portion (21%) of the Urban Waste Management Directorate’s planned spending on ‘new and upgrade’ initiatives over the next 10 years relates\
to the development of landfill infrastructure, including provision for the procurement of the regional landfill site in 2027/28. Alongside the development of landfill infrastructure, the Urban Waste Management Directorate aims to improve the City’s waste minimisation efforts, thereby slowing the rate\
of disposal at the City’s landfill sites in the future.

## Collections, cleansing, disposals and drop-offs

The need to divert waste from the City’s landfills\
is expected to increase with the imminent closure of Coastal Park as well as the continued extension and expansion of basic service delivery to informal settlements. In addition, the following factors are expected to inform the infrastructure needs of the City’s drop-off facilities:

* A proposed City amendment to the service radius of drop-off sites will see the radius decrease from 7 km to 3 km. This will require additional drop-offs to be established in Philippi, Mitchells Plain, Khayelitsha, Bellville and Durbanville and will necessitate waste disposal improvements in informal settlements. An estimated R600 million has been committed to develop new drop-off facilities.
* Storage capacity at drop-off sites is expected to come under strain as recycling efforts increase the volume of useable waste in the city. This will place pressure on the City to promote waste beneficiation and the implementation of a circular economy action plan in order to put usable waste to good use.
* Volatility in the recycled waste commodity market may also place additional pressure on storage capacity at the City’s waste facilities, as reduced export demand will force the City to stockpile export-ready recycled waste.

The majority (68%) of the Urban Waste Management Directorate’s planned capital spending on ‘refurbishment and replacement’ projects over the next 10 years relates to the repair of damaged or broken equipment at the City’s four regional transfer stations. This will ensure that the directorate can execute planned maintenance at these facilities over the next 10 years.

There are also significant capital commitments planned for the improvement of the Kraaifontein integrated waste management facility and Athlone refuse transfer station. This is aligned to the City’s goal to normalise integrated waste management as part of the City’s waste minimisation and recycling strategy.

There are also plans for shipping container replacement representing 17% of the sector’s ‘planned refurbishment and replacement’ spending over the next 10 years. Shipping containers are critical to waste collection and disposal efforts in informal settlements. Projects to replace shipping containers consistently over the next 10 years are therefore in line with the sector’s basic service response to informal settlements in the face of growing informality.

Planned spending on ‘new and upgrade’ infrastructure increases exponentially to 2028, declining thereafter, largely due to the development of transfer stations over the first seven years of the portfolio. Investment in transfer station development is in line with the directorate’s efforts to improve operational efficiencies at these sites. In addition to capacity improvements, investment in waste beneficiation at these sites will improve the City’s ability to divert waste from landfills, thereby protecting valuable airspace.
