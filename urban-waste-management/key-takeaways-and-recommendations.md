# Key Takeaways and Recommendations

* Capital commitments to refuse transfer stations, integrated waste management facilities and landfill infrastructure are aligned to the City’s intention to improve operational efficiency, promote waste beneficiation, and reduce the current volumes of waste to landfills.
* The EIA process for a new regional landfill has commenced and the requisite funds have been made available in the capital portfolio. The City will work to produce all necessary information and studies to expedite the EIA approval process to secure a site as soon as possible. This will prevent the potential need for the future diversion of waste to alternative landfill sites as a result of reaching current airspace limits before a new regional landfill site is developed.
* While provision for new waste drop-off sites has been made, additional capital projects are required if the City intends to reduce the service radius of drop-off sites from 7 km to 3 km in the short- to medium term.
* The capital projects within the portfolio address service delivery in informal settlements with provisions made for additional skips, drop-off sites and containers. However, these capital projects are an extension of the current service delivery model in informal settlements, which is both costly and has yet to address instances of illegal dumping. The Informal Settlement Waste Management Strategy should be completed as a matter of urgency so as to inform a more sustainable and effective approach to informal settlement waste management. Capital projects informed by this strategy should be defined and included in an updated sector plan as soon as possible.
* The inability of the City to access the rail network to transfer waste to and from refuse transfer stations inhibits the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of metropolitan solid waste management. In the face of fiscal constraints and Cape Town’s carbon emission goals, the City should continue to advocate for interventions that allow access to waste haulage services by rail.

**Kraaifontein integrated waste management facility**

An integrated waste management facility is a shared waste management facility where a combination of all integrated waste services are provided, such as composting of green waste, crushing of builders’ waste, a drop-off facility for general waste and recyclables, and a waste transfer station. It incorporates several waste controls and methods for waste disposal in one facility.
