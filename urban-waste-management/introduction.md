# Introduction

**Capetonians currently generate 4 400 tonnes of solid waste daily, equating to approximately 1,6 million tonnes of waste per year. The Urban Waste Management Directorate’s bulk infrastructure supports the City’s waste services through the provision of landfills, drop-off facilities, leachate plants, composting plants, refuse transfer stations, materials recycling facilities and waste management facilities.**

The long-term vision for Cape Town’s waste management infrastructure is not only to provide basic services, but also to augment economic activity and minimise the effects of waste on human and environmental health. Integrated waste minimisation and recycling are also significant components of Cape Town’s Climate Change Action Plan.

Waste minimisation systematically reduces waste ‘at source’, increases the efficiency of production, and protects the environment. For instance, the effectiveness of waste collection has a direct link to the quality of our rivers and waterways.

The likelihood that population growth in Cape Town will predominantly occur in informal settlements over the next 20 years means that there will be an increasing need for the City to extend waste collection to new settlements and improve the level of collection to meet demand in existing settlements as they grow.
