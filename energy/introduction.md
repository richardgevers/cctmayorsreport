# Introduction

**Energy is a primary input into the daily lives of Capetonians and an enabler of local economic development. Providing access to secure energy is critical to ensuring that residents and the economy in Cape Town can prosper and thrive.**

Some areas in Cape Town are supplied with electricity directly by Eskom and others by the City, as shown in figure 2. The supply areas are established under the National Electricity Regulation Act via the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) issued distribution licences. The Eskom distribution licence defines the Eskom supply area within Cape Town, and the City’s distribution licence defines the City’s supply area. Each licensee has exclusive authority to supply electricity and operate electricity networks in their supply area.

The City is thus prohibited by law from supplying, operating or responding to electricity faults in the Eskom supply area. The City also cannot determine or change the supply areas; only Nersa has the authority to make such changes. While Eskom infrastructure is mentioned in this section, as it impacts on City distribution, the primary focus is on assessing electricity infrastructure under the control and management of the City.

This City’s distribution network is supplied from the national grid via 37 points of delivery. Main substations transform the bulk power received at voltages of 132 kV, 66 kV and 33 kV to lower voltages (11 kV) for further distribution. A total of 76 main substations and 44 switching stations service the City’s supply area. Managing this network and supply is the primary responsibility of the City’s Energy Directorate.

Despite a very high (97,7% ) \[**footnote 1**] degree of electrification in the Cape Town metropolitan area, and the City’s provision of an energy services social package to low-income households – including subsidised grid connections, Lifeline and Home Light tariff \[**footnote 2**] and Free Basic Electricity (FBE) allocations – the most vulnerable households remain largely in a position of energy poverty.

Grid electrification can take up to three years from planning to implementation, leaving residents with an extended period during which they are without a formal electricity supply. Furthermore, grid electrification is not possible in informal settlements on encumbered land such as flood-risk zones, servitudes, and private land (unless permission is obtained from the private owner).

The City currently has no mechanism to provide alternative basic modern energy services in informal settlements that cannot be electrified. It is, however, investigating the possibility of providing these alternative energy services to residents in the future.

As South Africans are acutely aware, the national electricity network is under constant stress with load-shedding being a regular occurrence. Load-shedding has a direct negative impact on households and a devastating impact on businesses and the economy. It is for this reason that the City is committed to doing everything possible to mitigate the impacts of load-shedding in Cape Town.

The **Home Light tariff** is part of a suite of Eskom electricity tariffs based on the size of the supply that provides a subsidy to low-usage single-phase residential properties, churches, schools, halls, clinics, old-age homes or similar supplies in urban areas and electrification areas.

**Free Basic Electricity** is the electricity allocated by the City to support low-income households. It is the amount of electricity considered to be enough to run basic lighting, get basic media access, do ironing, and boil water using an electric kettle.

The **Lifeline tariff** applies to customers who:

\-  have a municipal property valuation of R400 000 or less;

\-  receive less than 450 kWh per month on average, including any free electricity; and&#x20;

\-   have a prepayment meter.

For customers who receive a pensioner or disabled persons rebate in terms of the rates policy; or who are tenants who otherwise would have qualified for such a rebate; or who are registered as indigent in terms of the Credit Control and Debt Collection Policy, the property valuation provision falls away.

Currently, the City is able to shield residents from up to two stages of load-shedding. It is undertaking several initiatives to further protect residents and end load-shedding in Cape Town over time. These include:

* Increasing the availability of dispatchable energy to limit the immediate impact of load-shedding via: › the Steenbras hydro pumped storage optimisation;
  * the dispatchable independent power producers (IPP) programme; and
  * developing a City battery energy storage systems (BESS) roadmap.
* Increasing installed capacity more generally to reduce load-shedding over time via: ›        the City-initiated embedded generation;
* the large-scale independent power producers programme;
  * customer-initiated embedded generation; and
  * wheeling[^1].
* Enabling an incentivised demand response from customers, via:
  * the Power Hero Programme (third-party demand response aggregators).\

**Wheeling** refers to the financial transactions representing the transportation of third-party electrical energy (kWh) over the municipal/Eskom distribution network. It allows a third-party supplier to sell this electrical energy to a customer at their point of supply. The sale is governed by a bilateral power purchase agreement (PPA) that exists within a market environment, as opposed to a regulated environment, as the price of the energy is set between the parties and not by the City/Eskom or the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa).
