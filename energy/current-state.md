# Current State

## **Distribution network**

The state of electricity distribution network infrastructure in the City’s municipal border as at January 2022 is as follows (see [annexure A:1](../annexures/annexure-a-energy.md#annexure-a-1-state-of-main-substation-non-firm-capacity-city-and-eskom-owned) for more details):

•       One area in the City supply area is reliant on infrastructure that has reached over-firm capacity and requires intervention. The firm capacity of this network was exceeded for only 34 (non-consecutive) hours in 2021 (i.e. less than 1% of the time).

•       A total of 10 Eskom-owned and maintained main substations (MSs) are over-firm capacity and present a risk to the reliability of supply to those residents in the Eskom supply areas.

•       There are City-supplied areas where the infrastructure is firm, but where the upstream Eskom infrastructure is non-firm or over-firm, e.g. City MSs receiving power from Eskom’s Philippi main transmission station (MTS).

•       In response to constraints at the Eskom-owned Philippi MTS, which supplies the Southern Peninsula, the City looped one of the Mitchells Plain-Steenbras 132 kV lines in and out of Eskom’s Pinotage MTS in 2020. This successfully prevented loss of supply for substantial periods during the Philippi transformer failure from October 2020 to June 2021.

The **state of electrical infrastructure** is determined by a network reliability index of firm vs. non-firm vs. over-firm capacity. **Firm capacity** indicates the network ability to withstand an N-1 fault condition, meaning that it is capable of experiencing an outage of a single network component without causing losses in electricity supply. This should not be confused with the total installed transformer capacity at the MS. **Over-firm capacity** means the demand peak (in MVA) for the preceding year exceeded the firm network capacity.

**Non-firm capacity** means the network is only designed for the normal system condition (N-0). During a single system component failure, electricity will be interrupted in line with the load supplied. The City aims to initiate projects when network capacity reaches 95% of firm capacity, subject to financial feasibility and the relevant governance processes.

New developments and/or new connections will nonetheless be considered on a case-by-case basis, even in non-firm/over-firm areas or areas identified as being at risk of over-firmness in the short- to medium-term.

## Generation

The City’s current generation assets comprise Steenbras hydro pumped storage (180 MW, 2 200 MWh) and two small gas turbines (78 MW), which are usually only run in emergencies. Steenbras can be operated in a range of ways depending on the objective, which normally is a reduction in maximum demand or energy arbitrage.\[**footnote 1**] Steenbras has also proven to be highly beneficial in limiting the stages of load-shedding experienced by City-supplied customers. The City’s generation facilities are all operational, but require varying levels of refurbishment to ensure operational quality and extension of life (see [annexure A:2](../annexures/annexure-a-energy.md#annexure-a-2-state-of-city-owned-generation-units) and [A:8](../annexures/annexure-a-energy.md#annexure-a-8-energy-directorates-list-of-new-and-upgrade-initiatives-for-the-period-2022-to-2031) for further details).
