# Future Outlook

Energy consumption has declined at an average\
annual rate of 1,9% since 2008/09 and this trend is expected to continue in the near future. Of the scenarios presented in the City’s energy consumption forecast, five of the six project a further decline in the City’s energy consumption within the next 10 years. Citywide economic growth, household income and energy- efficiency measures, as well as the adoption of small- scale embedded generation (SSEG) and electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to impact electricity consumption. This modelling does not yet take into account the sustained load-shedding experienced in 2022, which will likely further drive this downward consumption trend. To ensure that consistent planning assumptions are used across the City, it has also produced electricity consumption forecasts (see figure 3 below) based on the City’s Land Use Model (LUM) 2040, that is a forecasting tool which considers projected population growth and spatial location patterns. EV uptake is underpinned by the assumption that the manufacturing of internal combustion engines is likely to cease across the EU by 2030.

The ‘Energy Security for Economic Growth’ Mayoral Priority Programme will have a critical impact on the future of the City’s electricity infrastructure. The aim of this programme is to explore mechanisms to protect customers from load-shedding over time, while formalising current and undertaking additional reviews of power utility reform opportunities, and streamlining the embedded generation application process within the context of a longer-term Energy Strategy. In the interest of residents and businesses, the City will continue to seek out and implement measures to mitigate the impact of load-shedding for City-supplied customers based on financial feasibility and successful partnerships with energy system stakeholders.

The Energy Directorate has a fairly consistent capital spending plan for the next 10 years. The majority of this is committed to the expansion and development of new and existing assets, while spending on the rehabilitation and refurbishment of assets is projected to increase steadily over the next 10 years, peaking in 2029 and 2030.

**Small-scale embedded generation (SSEG)** refers to power generation facilities, located at residential, commercial, or industrial sites, where electricity is generally also consumed. These are mainly rooftop solar PV systems, but also include other technologies such as wind generation and biogas.

## Distribution network

While the City projects a decreasing overall demand of electricity, new housing and business developments (particularly data centres), as well as growth in low- income households, suggest that the location of electricity demand will change spatially.

The following future scenarios can be expected with regard to electricity distribution:

*   A total of 19 of the City’s 183 power transformers

    are expected to reach theoretical end-of-life in the next 10 years (see annexure A:4 for further details). End-of-lifecycle projects are subject to a thorough condition-based assessment of the equipment

    in order to determine the correct time of project

    initiation and potential extended useful life.
*   While the City’s measures to mitigate the risk of

    the currently over-firm Philippi MTS have been successful to date, it is vital that Eskom delivers the following two projects to alleviate the load at the Philippi MTS:

    1\. The new Erica main transmission substation – scheduled for commercial operation in 202812

    2\. The Philippi substation extension project – scheduled for commercial operation in 202613

    ‘System equipment and replacement’ is one of the two largest spending areas for planned refurbishment and replacement energy projects over the next 10 years. These projects are spatially situated across the City’s distribution network.

    The majority of the ‘new and upgrade’ projects planned in the next 10 years relate to transmission system

development (40%) and medium-voltage (MV) system infrastructure (18%). This is aligned with the Energy Directorate’s primary role as distributor of electricity to Cape Town’s residents. These infrastructure projects adequately address the existing and future over-firm capacities expected in the City.

## Generation

Large-scale electricity generation is being pursued in order to mitigate load-shedding in the future. Specifically, the City has initiated a process to procure electricity from IPPs and to increase its own generation capacity, for example, through the installation of solar PV systems that will generate 7 MW of electricity in Atlantis. A list of planned City-owned generation projects currently being pursued can be found in annexure A:6.

The City has installed a number of small-scale rooftop PV systems on City-owned facilities and will continue\
to do so in order to reduce its reliance on the national electricity grid and meet its carbon commitment goals. In this regard, investments in rooftop PV installations are noted in the planned, new and upgrade, energy projects between 2026 and 2030.

‘Electricity generation’ makes up the second largest spending item in planned refurbishment and replacement projects over the next 10 years. These projects address the refurbishment and replacement needs at the City’s three existing generating facilities of Steenbras, Roggebaai and Athlone (see annexures A:2 and A:8 for further details).
