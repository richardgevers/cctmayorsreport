# Key Takeaways and Recommendations

* The City’s planned infrastructure projects in energy over the next 10 years respond to over-firm distribution network concerns and accommodate energy-efficiency measures to support energy security and reduce the City’s carbon emissions.
* Capital commitments exist in the portfolio that support the MPP, including generation fleet, new ground-mounted PV, rooftop PV installations, resource efficiency in municipal buildings, and LED street lighting refurbishments.
* Electricity generation investments by the private sector and households are likely to rapidly increase due to licence changes and more severe load-shedding. The Energy Directorate has established a work package under the Energy Security for Economic Growth Programme to streamline the application and registration system for EGs.
