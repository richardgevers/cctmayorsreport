## Project Preparation

The following information is a summary of the City of Cape Town’s Stage Gate Review process that supports various elements of infrastructure delivery management and, more specifically, project preparation. The Stage Gate Process design was informed by the five-case model used by the UK Government and other international best practices.

Council adopted the MFMA Circular No. 106, Local Government Framework for Infrastructure Delivery and Procurement Management (LGFIDPM), as a best practice guideline that underpins the Stage Gate Review process. This is a formal process to specify, verify and record the transition between critical stages in the project and programme lifecycle.

A Stage Gate Review guideline has been developed to ensure understanding of, and compliance with, the process. It verifies acceptance of specific deliverables required for associated stages and ensures mutual understanding, alignment and commitment of key internal stakeholders as to what the project must accomplish. This process is designed for capital infrastructure projects and is based on well-proven techniques that lead to more effective delivery of benefits, together with more predictable costs and outcomes. It is compulsory for all capital infrastructure projects valued at R16 million or more to undergo this Stage Gate Review process.

Proper project and programme management implementation is vital to achieving specific outputs and outcomes that contribute to the desired results and objectives. The City has adopted a standard project lifecycle as shown in figure 17 that also indicates the Gate Review requirements after each stage.

A similar approach applies to programmes that follow a specific programme lifecycle and that are appraised at specific stages. Projects are managed through the PPM application and created as individual items with assigned project managers.

Each stage of a project and programme develops specific deliverables that are appraised in accordance with seven key focus areas/cases namely: strategy; socioeconomic; procurement; finance; commercial and regulatory; project management; and technical and engineering. These focus areas are appraised by subject matter experts within key City departments, in accordance with specific checklists developed per stage.

These are designed to ensure the relevant deliverables contain adequate information to justify the project proceeding to the next stage.

The project team presents the information to the Stage Gate Review Committee for approval to advance to the next sequential stage. Once the deliverables are appraised by the committee members, a recommendation report is compiled with potential corrective action items that need to be addressed by the project team. The project then either advances to the next stage, re-presents the current stage, or may be cancelled based on the committee’s recommendation.

This process has several benefits, but ultimately ensures adequate preparation and planning are done on infrastructure projects and programmes through the appraisal of key activities and deliverables at each stage. This, in turn, improves the likelihood of success and an outcome that meets with relevant stakeholders’ approval.
