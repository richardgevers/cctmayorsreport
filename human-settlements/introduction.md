# Introduction

The Human Settlements Directorate provides housing opportunities in the form of serviced sites and top structures, in line with the national housing programme outlined in the National Housing Code (2009). These programmes cover a range of housing typologies and the City balances its role as regulator, provider, and enabler in its efforts to support housing delivery. For the purposes of this report, human settlements infrastructure refers to public housing, hostels, formal housing, social housing and land available for development. In addition to formal housing programmes and the provision of serviced sites, the City’s in-situ informal settlement upgrading programme has also been considered.

The Mayoral Land Release Programme focuses on the identification and optimisation (and/or release) of City- owned land and buildings for affordable housing (as per the District SDFs and Local SDFs). These projects will not necessarily reflect in the City’s capital portfolio as these are not capital items.

The Mayor’s Sanitation and Inland Water Quality Programme will have a direct impact on the future infrastructure plans of the Water and Sanitation Directorate. These projects were not captured in the infrastructure plans of the directorate at the time of writing this report, but will be included in future reports.
