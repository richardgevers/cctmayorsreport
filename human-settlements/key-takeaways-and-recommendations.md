# Key Takeaways and Recommendations

* At current supply levels, housing supply does not meet housing demand in Cape Town.
* Currently, there is no sufficiently systematic and programmatic approach to meeting housing demand across multiple housing typologies. That said, the Human Settlements Strategy does set\
  out human settlements challenges and potential responses, with action required from multiple directorates and external stakeholders. However, the current sector plan does not provide an appropriate gap analysis between current housing opportunity development rates and required housing opportunity development rates. It also does not quantify the funding requirements, over the short, medium and long term, to bring housing opportunity production up to acceptable levels to address current backlogs and meet future demand in the income categories that the City currently serves. This is being addressed in a sector plan update that is currently underway.
* Inadequacies in programme planning have significant downstream consequences for the other sectors as well. A clear pipeline of planned human settlements projects would provide certainty to the bulk infrastructure sectors on where large increases in demand are likely to take place. Without this information, the City creates a chicken-and-egg situation whereby potentially viable sites for human settlements development cannot be utilised because of a lack of bulk infrastructure capacity.
* Despite a clear demand for housing, there is a significant drop-off in human settlements projects (top structures) in the outer years of the portfolio. While this is due to the uncertainty surrounding grant funding, the City leadership has directed that the full pipeline of what is needed be captured in internal project management systems, so as not to impede long-term project planning across the City’s directorates. This will ensure that planning leads the budget process rather than the other way around. The City is thus actively working through the sector plan update to ensure a healthy pipeline of execution-ready human settlements projects across the 10-year portfolio, using a broad range of typologies as set out in the Human Settlements Strategy.

It should be noted that public funding will only be able to account for a small portion of housing provision in the future. As such, the City’s investment focus has shifted to unlocking the potential for quality private housing supply in less formal areas.
