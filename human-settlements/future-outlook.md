# Future Outlook

The Human Settlements Directorate estimates that, by 2028, the total demand for housing will range between 479 200 and 529 300 housing opportunities required. At present supply rates, this will result in a shortfall of between 22 970 and 27 980 housing opportunities per annum. The Human Settlements Directorate will therefore come under increasing pressure to provide housing opportunities while continuing to upgrade informal settlements in the face of growing informality.\
In response to the above, the Human Settlements Directorate has committed to the following programmes:

## Priority investment projects

Future developments Cape Town will be focused on the urban inner core, incremental growth areas and consolidation areas, with additional projects being located along transport corridors. This is in line with the MSDF and Priority Human Settlements and Housing Development Area as gazetted by the National Human Settlements Department. Figure 13 shows the areas identified for human settlements investment within the catalytic investment area. These projects consist of a mixture of housing typologies (see annexure D:1 for further details).

The Human Settlements’ planned capital spending over the next 10 years increases steadily in the first five years from 2022 to 2026 and then again from 2027 to 2031 due to the Human Settlements sector’s reliance on grant funding cycles.

The majority (68%) of the Human Settlements Directorate’s planned capital spend over the next 10 years is committed to the provision of serviced sites (i.e. including internal services such as water and electricity). This is in line

with the recent national directive that grant funding Human Settlements Development Grant (HSDG) should prioritise the supply of serviced sites instead of BNG top structures. Top structures will be developed for select vulnerable groups such as the elderly and disabled, child-headed households and military veterans.

A total of 24 691 formal housing opportunities and 15 533 social housing units are currently in planning at various decision points. This equates to 40 224 housing opportunities over the 10-year period, or approximately 8% of the City’s 2028 housing requirements.

## Formal housing development

The current list of formal housing developments in planning by the Human Settlements Directorate is expected to yield approximately 32 243 housing opportunities over the next 10 years, representing 49% of the total planned ‘new and upgrade’ capital projects planned by the City for the next 10 years.

Top structure development is provided only for the first five years of the planned capital projects. This is a reflection of the sector’s reliance on grant funding to develop these structures, as well as policy uncertainty around the long-term financial sustainability of the BNG programme.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Formal housing developments** fall into four categories:

* Breaking New Ground (BNG) – joint monthly income \<R3 500
* The Enhanced People’s Housing Process (EPHP) – joint monthly income \<R3 500
* Gap housing – joint monthly income of between R3 501 and R22 000
* Social housing – joint monthly income of between R1 850 and R22 000
{% endhint %}

## Public housing stock

Planned capital spend on ‘refurbishment and replacement’ capital projects relating to rental housing stock is consistent over the 10 years from 2022 to 2031. This is concerning, given planned additional public housing units in the human settlements pipeline. The addition of rental stock will necessitate increases in the provision of capital and operational funds for the maintenance and refurbishment of these units. Planned capital project spend over the 10-year period is weighted in line with the number of housing units in each of the City’s four services areas, with the central area making up 71% of all housing stock.

## Hostels

A relatively small provision of R2,75 million has been committed to the transformation and development of the remaining 46 hostels. This is due to national policy and grant funding changes that prevent the use of HSDG money for the construction of rental housing opportunities.

## Backyard dwellers (backyarders)

The prevalence of backyard dwellers will increase in line with the growing need for housing in the city. Ultimately, it is the City’s desire that all backyarders should have access to water, sanitation, and electricity, with a priority focus on backyarders in City-owned rental housing. It is the City’s intent to establish a policy framework for the administration of backyard structures and to put mechanisms in place for basic service access for backyarders. The City has adopted the following two backyarder programmes:

1. **Backyard dwelling service support project (City public rental stock):** The City will prioritise the connection of these households to basic services infrastructure, including electricity, water and sanitation connections.
2. **Backyard dwelling service support project (private properties):** \[**footnote 1**]The City proactively plans for density and the upgrades of infrastructure in these areas to prevent infrastructure failures and ensure a healthy urban environment. In addition, the City works to ensure that each property is connected to water, sanitation, and electricity, with the property owner carrying the responsibility for the further connections and infrastructure required on the property to provide services to additional dwellings.

{% hint style="info" %}
Backyarder refers to a person occupying a backyard residential unit under some type of rental agreement with the main homeowner or City tenant. The backyard unit is a structure constructed of any material, intended or used for human habitation, on the same residential property as a main dwelling, built according to approved plans (formal) or no approved plans (informal backyard), and is therefore not categorised as an informal settlement.
{% endhint %}

## Informal settlements

Population growth, in-migration and poor socioeconomic conditions are expected to contribute to the growth in informal settlements in Cape Town. This requires that the City works with informality using a dual approach:

Firstly, where settlements have no services (generally as a result of unlawful land occupation), emergency relief services are provided where possible.

Secondly, where settlements have some basic services, full basic service upgrading can be provided, with a ratio of one water point for every 25 households and\
one toilet for every five households. Extension of basic services to informal settlements is undertaken using a ‘superblock’ or ‘serviced site’ approach. Planned informal settlement upgrades make up 38% of the total planned ‘new and upgrade’ capital projects planned by the Human Settlements Directorate over the next 10 years. This focus on informal settlements is aligned to the City’s strategy to accommodate growing informality in Cape Town.

The Human Settlements Directorate has committed to a total of 38 capital projects in informal settlements over the next 10 years, which will impact approximately 39 689 households. Of these, 17 relate to serviced sites, 12 to superblocking and nine to enhancing services.

{% hint style="info" %}
A **superblock** comprises a residential block of approximately 90 m x 30 m with the provision of shared water (1:25 ratio), sanitation (1:5 ratio), door-to-door waste collection and individual electrification. All roads, stormwater and pedestrian accessways are developed to an A-grade standard.

A **serviced site** refers to a plot or site demarcated in a general plan, with individual municipal services such as water and sanitation.

**In-situ upgrading** provides every household in the settlement with its own individual serviced site (no or limited relocation required).&#x20;

**Re-blocking and enhanced re-blocking** unfold as above, but through collaboration between NGOs and community, top structures are improved from basic informal structures (no or limited relocation required).

**Superblocks** provide formal access roads with formal services infrastructure, but no individual serviced sites and only shared services (no or minimal relocation initially required).

**The Managed Settlement Programme** is a greenfield site prepared for rapid occupation with shared services initially, but with the potential to upgrade\
to individual serviced sites over time. The owner constructs the top structure.
