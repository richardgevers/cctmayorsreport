# Current State

The Human Settlements Sector Plan focuses on developing and enabling integrated human settlements for households that earn a monthly income of R22 000 or less. This equates to 76% of all households in Cape Town. Determining the exact shortage of housing in the city is challenging, however the following facts provide an indication of the magnitude and typology of\
housing requirements:

* There is a shortfall of between 22 970 and 27 980 housing units per annum at current supply rates.
* As of January 2022, 359 277 applicants had registered their need for housing on the City’s Housing Needs Register.
* Based on household income trends in Cape Town, the most in-demand housing typography is social and public housing for renters and gap market housing for prospective homeowners (see annexure D:2 for further details) who earn between R3 501 and R10 000 per month. However, a clear view in terms of preference between ownership and rental is not possible
* The City’s human settlements plans do not currently include a determination of the appropriate mix of owned or rented units.

The **Housing Needs Register** provides an accessible account of residents who have expressed their need for state-assisted housing (ownership and rental tenure) and it records beneficiaries of the City’s various housing programmes through a single, centrally managed list.

## Public housing stock

At the time of producing this report, the City owns 50 085 public housing rental units that are divided into saleable and non-saleable units. The units are aimed at providing affordable rental housing to residents who earn R15 000 or less per month.

## Hostels

There are 47 hostels in Cape Town located across six wards in Nyanga, Langa and Gugulethu, accounting for a total of 18 243 hostel beds. The existing hostel buildings, which need redevelopment, are located in established urban areas where land availability is limited.

In response to the need to upgrade the hostels, the City embarked on a Hostel Redevelopment Programme to transform the existing hostels into community residential units, i.e. rental units. To date, the City has successfully concluded one hostel redevelopment project in 2016 in Langa, named Hamilton Nake Square. Two additional hostel transformation projects were planned, however due to national policy and grant funding changes, these planned projects have been put on hold. At present, it is not possible to determine a project start date.

## Land reservations

Adequate and suitable land is required to deliver affordable housing. The City currently has over 12,2 million m2 of reserved land parcels for the purpose of delivering affordable housing (see annexure D:3 for further details).
