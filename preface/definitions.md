| Affordable housing                 | Affordability is a function of context. National Government determines that the gap market (those households who should be targeted for affordable housing provision) refers to households earning less than R22 000 per month. The Municipal Spatial Development Framework (MSDF) and District Spatial Development Framework (DSDF) recognise that nominal indicator while maintaining that affordability fluctuates depending on the context in which housing is available; and that it would never be targeted at the highest earning income group of that context. In this Spatial Development Framework (SDF), affordable housing refers specifically to the household income brackets of R3 501 to R22 000 per month, which is in line with current national income thresholds. The term is inclusive of social, gap, and inclusionary housing. Different government subsidised products (rental and ownership) target different household incomes. R22 000 is also the upper threshold for the Financed-linked Individual Subsidy Programme (FLISP) which enables households to purchase their own homes. It also refers to residential units valued at approximately R634 000 or less (for 2022 at 5% annual increase from R522 000 in 2018). In the city of Cape Town, on average between 2015 and 2018, 70% of households earned below R20 0001 \[**footnote 1**]. |

| Aggregator \[**footnote 2**]       | An aggregator is a grouping of agents in a power system (i.e consumers, producers, prosumers or any mix thereof) to act as a single entity when engaging in power system markets (both wholesale and retail) or selling services to the operator.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Carbon neutral                     | Limiting the carbon emissions produced citywide to a point of neutrality from energy use, transport, and waste that can be absorbed or offset.

| Climate change mitigation          | The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects \[**footnote 4**]. It’s a human intervention to reduce emissions or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases in the context of climate change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Transit-oriented development (TOD) | Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a multifaceted and targeted strategic land development approach to improve urban efficiencies and sustainability by integrating and aligning land development and public transport services provision. It promotes inward growth and compact city form, with an emphasis on building optimum relationships between urban form, development type, development intensity, development mix and public transport services to create a virtuous cycle of benefits over the long term as described in the City of Cape Town’s TOD Strategic Framework. Different TOD objectives, tools and outcomes are applicable at metropolitan, corridor, nodal, precinct and project scales.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Transit corridors                  | Transit corridors include one or more routes that connect centres of economic activity. The routes have different alignments but common transfer points and common ends, which are gateways that allow traffic to enter or exit the corridor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Triggers                           | According to the medium-growth scenario (as per the detailed demand forecasting model), triggers will cause main substation supply areas (as mentioned in the “Infrastructure Name” column) to become over-firm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
