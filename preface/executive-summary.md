# Executive Summary

The vision for Cape Town is to be a City of Hope for all – a prosperous, inclusive and healthy city where people can see their hopes of a better future become a reality, for themselves, their children and their community. To this end, the City is focused on creating the conditions for meaningfully faster economic growth, which will enable more Capetonians to lift themselves out of poverty and take advantage of the opportunities available to them. Investment in Cape Town’s infrastructure is critically important to achieve this vision because it reduces the barriers to opportunity and creates pathways to greater economic participation and social mobility. New, and well-maintained existing, infrastructure assets also give the Cape Town economy a competitive advantage, stimulate growth and support inclusive economic development.

The 2022 Infrastructure Report is the first consolidated attempt by the City to evaluate its infrastructure delivery plans for the next 10 years. This first Infrastructure Report is limited to the evaluation of the City’s bulk infrastructure across the five directorates of Energy, Urban Waste Management, Water and Sanitation, Human Settlements and Urban Mobility. The analysis is based on data extracted from the City’s project preparation management system (SAP PPM) as at 4 May 2022.

{% hint style="info" %}
The term **bulk infrastructure** refers to the public infrastructure by means of which water, sewerage and electricity services are provided and managed. This includes infrastructure involved in generation, collection, storage, purification, conveyancing and disposal, as the case may be, and which is connected to the reticulation system that, in turn, distributes services to or from end users (City customers).
{% endhint %}

This report aims to answer three main questions:

1. Is the City’s bulk infrastructure master planning in these five sectors adequate?
2. Does the City bulk infrastructure pipeline in these five sectors meet current and future demand?
3. If the answer to question 2 is ‘no’, are there projects in the pipeline that will address any shortfalls?

This report lays the foundation for future, deeper analysis across the City’s infrastructure portfolio, including additional typologies of infrastructure such as community facilities, reticulation and distribution infrastructure, environmental infrastructure, etc. Future iterations of this report may also include other aspects, such as reviews of infrastructure requirements related to precincts/ areas (location-based analysis) or specific typologies of infrastructure (thematic-based analysis). Importantly, future iterations of the report will deepen the City’s understanding of its infrastructure planning, risk and delivery against organisational strategic objectives.

The City’s infrastructure planning and projects must consider all future realities and challenges, including the following key trends:

* Increasing informality and unplanned densification
* A growing population
* Declining household income
* Increasing occurrence of extreme climate events and related shocks
* The ongoing inadequacy and unreliability of passenger rail.

In this regard, demographic changes are of critical importance to infrastructure planning to ensure that the right infrastructure gets built, in the right locations and at the right time, in order to meet future demand. For this reason, the City’s long-term planning is informed by long-term population projections. The latest City projections, as used in the IDP and MSDF, suggest 5,8 million people will reside in Cape Town by 2040. This represents 1,75 million more people than the current population. It is thus critical that infrastructure planning keeps pace with this growth to ensure that services exist in the future to meet the requirements of this growing population.

The findings of this report indicate that infrastructure capacity constraints exist, to varying degrees, across all of the five sectors evaluated. Exacerbated by backlogs in investment and maintenance, these constraints impede the City’s ability to deliver services, adapt to increasing instances of climate-related risk, promote economic opportunity, and respond to the growing Cape Town population.

This report highlights the following about the City’s current response to infrastructure constraints:

* Considerable efforts to address existing infrastructure constraints in the Energy, Urban Waste Management, and Water and Sanitation Sector Plans. This is evidenced by planned projects within each directorate that, to a large extent, aim to address existing investment backlogs and improve infrastructure capacity to meet future demand.
* Despite programmes in the Human Settlements Sector Plan that aim to tackle the city’s complex human settlements issues, there is a clear gap between the current demand and supply of housing.
* The City is spending almost half of the capital budget allocated to Urban Mobility on roads infrastructure.

An analysis of the current state of infrastructure, against the planned capital investment projects across the five directorates, revealed the following key findings:

* The integrated portfolio is generally responsive to future trends in the water and sanitation, energy, and urban waste management sectors.
* Neither the Urban Mobility nor the Human Settlements directorates have adequate plans to match the scale of current need (next five years), nor are there sufficient projects in the five- to 10-year horizon to meet future demand. This is largely as a result of a grantdependent approach to funding projects in these sectors. The City leadership has given direction that all sectors must plan for required critical infrastructure, regardless of certainty of funding. In response, the sector plans are being updated and enhanced on the understanding that the question of financing will be dealt with in the formal budgeting process.
* The City does not currently have a full set of stormwater master plans for each catchment area, and the process to develop them has a long lead time. Additional funding is being sourced to shorten the projected timelines.

Master planning is a key informant of infrastructure planning and investment; however, the adequacy of master planning varies across the City’s directorates. Inadequacies or gaps in master planning data prevent the City from doing the following:

* Evaluating the degree to which infrastructure addresses the future needs of the City.
* Assessing whether the City is spending enough on infrastructure in each sector.
* Implementing effective evidence-based infrastructure decision making that is informed by accurate data.

The City will therefore prioritise master planning in order to ensure that infrastructure decisions are informed by current and future realities of the city. Long-term infrastructure planning in the City remains a challenge, as demonstrated by the relative absence of capital projects in the outer years of the next 10-year period. This can be explained by the volume of current infrastructure backlogs in the City that consumes immediate focus, as well as the current gaps in master planning in the City.

The City is committed to improving capital planning in the outer years and is actively pursuing improvements in project preparation, master planning, and project prioritisation, as well as resourcing and prioritisation of long-term planning in the City.

The findings of the assessment of the planned capital projects over the next 10 years that increase existing bulk infrastructure capacity, are in line with the City’s spatial strategy to promote ‘inward growth’ of urban development. However, the absence of projects relating to the expansion of public transport networks hinders the City’s strategies to promote transportoriented development. In light of this, a revision of the City’s Integrated Transport Plan (CITP) is essential. This revision is currently under way. The CITP must inform an adequate pipeline of capital projects that is aligned to the City’s spatial strategies, which should be included in future updates of the Transport Sector Plan.

This report also outlines findings that, in several cases, infrastructure owned and operated by other spheres of government has a direct negative impact on the City’s bulk infrastructure in the five directorates assessed. The City will drive an active programme of advocacy over the next five years and will include the following infrastructure pressure points:

* The new Erica main transmission substation – scheduled for commercial operation in 2028 \[**footnote 1**]
* The Philippi substation extension project – scheduled for commercial operation in 2026 \[**footnote 2**]
* Access to rail for waste haulage
* Passenger rail

Infrastructure project preparation and spending are a significant challenge across South Africa and in all spheres of government. The City is committed to growing its portfolio of implementation-ready projects to ensure that it is able to spend its capital budgete.&#x20;

Every year, able to grow its capital budget annually, and able to increase the potential for projects to be brought forward should additional funding become available.
