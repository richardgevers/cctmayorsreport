This report is the culmination of years of work that I have personally overseen and driven across the administration. This work has been behind the scenes, building the systems and processes necessary to be able to assess the full suite of infrastructure plans across the organisation, not just for the next year or even five-year term of office, but for the long term.

Having sight of the Cityâ€™s long-term infrastructure pipelines is important for many reasons. Our long-term planning allows us to plan, prepare and deliver infrastructure better by identifying and filling gaps that exist. Long-term planning and pipelines also allow us to identify synergies between directorates which can drive efficiencies and cost savings into the future.

For the private sector, I trust this report will provide a level of certainty over future major capital investments across the metro, to enable economic growth and reliable services. This report will also be of interest to Province as they plan in areas of intersecting responsibility, and for our colleagues in National Government, especially National Treasury, who will be able to gain insight and certainty about future funding needs and opportunities in the City of Cape Town.

This report identifies several infrastructure investments needed from state-owned enterprises and other spheres of government. The City administration will work closely with the Mayor and his team to ensure we do everything possible to make sure our intergovernmental partners deliver for our city.

A priority for me, which is also expressed in the IDP, is the enablement of a modernised and adaptive city government. Key to this is optimisation and innovation, and this report is one such expression of this intent. The City of Cape Town is committed to constantly improving its services through innovation. Important building blocks for this are system enhancements to the way we plan, prepare and deliver infrastructure for the benefit of the future Cape Town.

This report shows that in the main, the City of Cape Town has robust long-term infrastructure plans to deliver bulk infrastructure to the areas of future growth. These plans will allow us to drive project preparation and execution on critical projects. We are not perfect and this report does identify gaps in some areas, but what it also shows is that we already have plans to actively address those gaps.

Capetonians can read this report and rest assured that this administration is actively planning for the future and doing what we need to today to create a City of Hope.
