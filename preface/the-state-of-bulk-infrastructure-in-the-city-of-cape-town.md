# The State of Bulk Infrastructure in the City of Cape Town

According to current projections, in the next 20 years, Cape Town will experience the following:

•       a growing population

•       a reduction in household income

•       increasing informality

•       increasingly frequent and intense extreme climate events

Effective, long-term infrastructure planning will be critical to managing the future realities that are within the City’s control, such as extending basic services, and adapting to those realities over which the City has little or no control, such as extreme weather events.

In addition to these possible future realities, the City is by no means starting from an equal baseline. Overcoming historical backlogs and the legacy of apartheid spatial planning remain key informants for Cape Town’s future infrastructure requirements.

In order to plan for these future realities, the City recognised that a thorough stocktake of the existing state of its bulk infrastructure departments was needed.

This report aims to answer three main questions:

1\.      Is the City’s bulk infrastructure master planning in the five sectors mentioned adequate?

2\.      Does the City bulk infrastructure pipeline in these five sectors meet current and future demand?

3\.      If the answer to 2 above is ‘no’, does the City have projects in the pipeline to address the shortfalls?

In addition to assessing the current state of infrastructure and future outlook of the five directorates and the sectors they represent, the report also makes recommendations for strengthening infrastructure delivery in each case.&#x20;
