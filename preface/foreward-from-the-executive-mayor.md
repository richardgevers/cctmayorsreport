Infrastructure enables productivity and productivity drives growth. We cannot build a Cape Town that offers residents hope of a more prosperous life without world class infrastructure. It must be at the forefront of the  City’s governance agenda.

While Cape Town stands apart from other metros as one place where most infrastructure is kept in working order, we have challenges of our own. Over the past few years, we have underinvested in new infrastructure and allowed maintenance backlogs to build up, especially during the drought and over the pandemic period. This is not good enough.

This report is clear and honest about the City’s past shortcomings and makes no attempt to hide them.  It is also clear about the solutions. Having identified the infrastructural factors holding Cape Town back from greater success, it explains in detail how we are going to fix them. In essence, in the next ten years, we are investing in infrastructure and performing maintenance on a scale unseen in decades. The upscaling of the City’s capital budget over the medium-term revenue expenditure framework (MTREF) period demonstrates our commitment to this goal.

We have a lot of work to do to get on the right trajectory across all infrastructural sectors. But I am confident that, through this plan, Cape Town will have water and sanitation, waste, energy, and transport infrastructure that will rival that of the world’s best-run cities.

A key challenge the writers of this report have taken into account is the fact that, as cities and towns across the country continue to crumble, more people are moving to Cape Town. This will increase the already above-average population growth Cape Town is experiencing as a result of urbanisation trends.

To ensure that ‘semigration’ is maximally beneficial to our local economy (as opposed to a burden), we are planning for a future Cape Town that is far bigger than the one of today. The report not only takes the enhanced demand for infrastructure arising from population growth into account, but also plans for eventualities such as increasing levels of informality and unplanned densification, the increasing inadequacy of public transport offerings, and declining average household incomes. Accordingly, we will remain resilient in the face of (even extreme) change.

I hope Capetonians will feel a sense of renewal and vitality as the City government rolls up its sleeves to build a Cape Town for the future. I, for one, can’t wait to see Cape Town become one big construction and maintenance site. This will mean progress, prosperity, and flourishing. And that is what we are here to achieve.
