# Financing for Infrastructure

While investment in urban infrastructure drives economic growth, that investment must first be financed. The City has four main sources through which it finances infrastructure projects and funds their operation and maintenance:

#### Revenue

This is income generated by the City through rates, tariffs and development contributions. It accounts for a very small portion of overall infrastructure financing.

#### External Financing Fund

External, long-term loans are used to finance the outlay of capital assets funded by the External Financing Fund (EFF). The EFF is one of the largest sources of funding for infrastructure investments by the City.

The City funds a large portion of capital infrastructure investments through the issue of municipal bonds or by obtaining external loans from financial institutions. The City has issued four bonds thus far to raise external finance. These bonds are listed on the JSE (formally, the Bond Exchange of South Africa) and have raised R5,2 billion as part of the Cityâ€™s R7 billion Domestic Medium-Term Note Programme (DMTN).

#### Grants and donations

The City receives a number of intergovernmental transfers from National and Provincial Government in the form of conditional grants. These are particularly important to fund infrastructure in the human settlements and urban mobility sectors, although the lack of certainty regarding future grants makes long-term planning in these sectors challenging.

#### Capital replacement reserve

The City maintains a dedicated reserve of funding for the replacement of capital assets. At present, the majority of capital replacement reserve funding is committed to the Energy (49%) and Urban Mobility (34%) directorates. Below is an overview of planned infrastructure over the next 10 years. Importantly, this represents amounts planned, but not necessarily committed, as projects need to pass a project preparation process to prove their readiness before they can be allocated funding through the budget process.
