# Introduction

As the backbone of the economy, infrastructure is vital to productivity, competitiveness and increasing the quality of life for people across Cape Town. It acts as a direct ‘input’ for businesses and residents, that rely on the dependable delivery of basic services. The demand for these services has increased significantly over the past several decades, emphasising the importance of well-maintained, high-quality, and effective infrastructure to the economy, environment, society, and continued development. However, long-standing challenges continue to affect the City’s ability to deliver the required infrastructure.

Key historical challenges include inadequate spending commitments, policy uncertainties, and a lack of precise data on the state, quality and performance of existing assets. The Covid-19 pandemic added another layer of complexity by significantly affecting infrastructure development. This has highlighted the critical importance of many infrastructure systems and services, both for maintaining economic and social activity, and enabling responses to unexpected threats and challenges. Specifically, during the pandemic, the City saw a significant increase in theft of infrastructure assets. The pandemic also had a significant negative impact on the economy, which was exacerbated in Cape Town due to the city’s large tourism industry. As a result of the pandemic, and in line with the national trend, economic growth in Cape Town contracted by 5,1% in 2020 \[**footnote 1**] and 4,9% in 2021. As a result, the need to grow the economy has never been more pressing.

Infrastructure systems, in particular, form the basis of building resilient societies and are crucial in renewing the fabric of a city. They form the basis of economic recovery by creating the conditions conducive to longterm sustainable growth. In light of this, it is critical for the City to focus on the ways in which infrastructure delivery can best support Cape Town’s recovery from recent shocks. According to the City’s latest model, demographic projections suggest 5,8 million people will reside in Cape Town by 2040. This is 1,75 million Project and portfolio management (PPM): The delivery of quality infrastructure is directly impacted by the quality of project management. As such, the City has, in recent years, worked to strengthen its project and contract management capabilities. In addition, the City has adopted a portfolio management approach whereby all capital projects are managed through a central system called SAP PPM. All information relating to a given project is captured and regularly updated on this system, which helps determine whether the project is ready to progress to the next stage of development or not.

The City’s 2022 Infrastructure Report forms the basis for a long-term approach to investing in infrastructure to improve the quality, accessibility and sustainability of services that Capetonians use every day. This report leverages existing investments in project and portfolio management and sector planning to enable an evidencebased, data-driven, and integrated approach to longterm and strategic infrastructure investment and delivery. In this regard, the analysis is based on data extracted from the City’s project preparation management system (SAP PPM) as at 4 May 2022. The report provides a technical assessment of the implementation and delivery of Council-approved plans and strategies, guided by the IDP and MSDF, in order to improve planning and project preparation. This marks a decisive step change in the City’s infrastructure ambitions.

**Sector plans**: These plans provide an assessment of infrastructure needs over a 20-year period. They are a critical link between the spatial strategies of the MSDF and the land-use forecasts that inform them, as well as the medium- and short-term instruments of the IDP and budget. They provide detailed insight to guide decision making related to investment in infrastructure.

Given the important information provided in this technical assessment, a decision was taken to make a summary available to the public.

The objectives of the 2022 Infrastructure Report are:

* To provide a consolidated view of the City’s infrastructure pipeline planning
* To show how the City’s capital investments support its spatial strategy. As such, the report will serve as the Capital Expenditure Framework (CEF) for the City
* To serve as a strategic mirror, to determine whether infrastructure is:
  * meeting capacity needs and demand;
  * aligned to the City’s strategic priorities and objectives; and
  * facilitating the City’s climate adaptation and mitigation efforts
* To highlight critical projects that need to be supported for project preparation and execution to meet current or future demand
* To provide the basis for key communication and advocacy with Provincial and National government and state-owned entities (SOEs).
* To provide a stocktake of the implementation of the City’s infrastructure strategy (Infrastructure Planning and Delivery Framework) and key planning interventions
* To create the opportunity to do a ‘deep dive’ or thematic infrastructure analysis into areas of particular concern (e.g. sewage-related infrastructure).

The report evaluates the City’s spatial, infrastructure and financial planning against the IDP over the 10-year period on basic and economic infrastructure linked to bulk municipal service delivery. This first iteration is limited to the energy, solid waste, water and sanitation, human settlements, and transport (urban mobility) sectors.
