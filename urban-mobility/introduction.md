# Introduction

**The aim of transport infrastructure is to provide affordable and efficient public transport-, roads-, and transport-related infrastructure that ensures the city’s residents can access economic and social opportunities in an affordable manner. This objective is further supported by transport-related operations, regulations, management and enforcement, as well as direct public transport services provided through MyCiTi.**

Given the failure of rail as a public transport mechanism over the last decade, the majority of Cape Town’s daily commuters now use private transport (58%), followed by minibus-taxis (22%), formal bus services (9%), and non-motorised transport (9%). Rail currently serves only 2% of commuters.
