# Current State

Transport flexibility is the key metric used to assess the adequacy of Cape Town’s transport infrastructure. This is a measure of how many members of the Cape Town population have access to at least three relatively frequent public transport modes (e.g. minibus-taxis, Golden Arrow and MyCiTi buses) within a radius of 500m.

At present, only 11% of the city’s population has full transport flexibility. The City is committed to addressing this lack of transport flexibility, particularly in the areas of greatest need. An example of this commitment is the roll- out of the MyCiTi corridor in the metro south-east, which will link Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain to Claremont and Wynberg.

## Public transport

The City’s public transport infrastructure is informed by the Integrated Public Transport Network (IPTN) plan. The plan comprises trunk services (i.e. rail and the bus rapid transit (BRT) service), supported by feeder services, and non-motorised transport (NMT) infrastructure. It is an integral component to the MSDF as it represents the spatial backbone around which the future Cape Town can be restructured. The trunk routes of the IPTN service link nodes within the city’s urban inner core and enhance mobility and efficiency of movement for residents and visitors.

The MyCiTi BRT system is designed to complement the existing rail system. Phase 1 of the MyCiTi BRT system has been completed and the N2 Express has been revived. Work is currently under way to construct MyCiTi causeways, and upgrade the public transport interchanges (PTIs) along the new BRT corridor. Other PTIs are also being upgraded, or are earmarked for upgrading. As the key informant to the City’s Public Transport Plan, the IPTN is currently being revised and updated, with a focus on the importance of planning in uncertainty and making resilient choices.

While the BRT system is designed to complement the existing rail system, the absence of a functional and reliable passenger rail system requires the City to respond with increased road-based options (such as the N2 Express), which in turn requires significant subsidisation and directly impacts operational expenditure. For this reason, the City is investigating the devolution of aspects of the passenger rail system in Cape Town.

## Roads

As the reliability and safety of rail transport has diminished, road-based public transport has become increasingly important. This places growing stress on Cape Town’s road network. In response, the Urban Mobility Directorate has several programmes in place relating to road bulk infrastructure, including: the Congestion Relief Programme; the maintenance of roads under the City’s jurisdiction; and various programmes relating to operations, NMT, safety and transport systems management.

The Congestion Relief Programme includes 14 projects, six of which relate to new infrastructure builds, while the remaining eight are expansions of existing infrastructure. These programmes are intended to relieve congestion on the city’s main road networks. As of the 2021/22 financial year, two projects had begun construction (see annexure E:1 for further details). The Roads Maintenance Programme focuses on the overall maintenance and rehabilitation of the city’s road network. The projects include rehabilitation, resurfacing, resealing, patching and minor base repairs. They are funded from the operating budget (see annexure E:1 for further details).
