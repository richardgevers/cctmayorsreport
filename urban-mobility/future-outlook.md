# Future Outlook

The City is currently finalising its Comprehensive Integrated Transport Plan (CITP) 2023–2028, which sets out the ways in which the safety, convenience, reliability and quality of public transport services can be improved, for the greatest number of residents, as quickly as possible. The plan outlines an incremental approach to drive rapid, smaller-scale improvements across multiple transport modes, ensuring a range of interventions to improve the network for road- based public transport services such as MBT and GABS. It also proposes increased investment in NMT (recognising the percentage of commuters for who

NMT forms part of their journey) as well as a viable and implementable plan of action for the revival of Cape Town’s rail system. The Urban Mobility Directorate’s planned capital projects increase steadily to 2026 and drop off considerably after 2027 as a result of the metro south-east corridor spend, which is largely reliant on government grant funding. Planned capital spending from 2027 onwards relates largely to the Congestion Relief Programme, but further BRT interventions will be added once the IPTN is finalised. The continued attention to road maintenance is considered a responsible approach to road asset management.

## Public transport

The metro south-east corridor of the MyCiTi BRT is currently under construction and will be rolled out across 10 trunk routes. Once fully rolled out, it will serve more than 1,4 million commuters. This will provide the missing east-central trunk link across the southern part of the urban inner core and help the City deliver on its commitment to continuously improve transport options for all residents.

The provision of NMT infrastructure, which is complementary to the BRT service, is integral to this plan and is envisaged to support the commuter and promote the associated economic benefits created by the associated foot traffic.

A lack of planned ‘rehabilitation and refurbishment’ capital projects relating to public transport interchange has been noted beyond 2025. This is concerning given the intended expansion of the MyCiTi BRT. As earlier phases of the BRT network age, and an extension of the network results in increased use of key nodes, the need for refurbishment will increase.

Planned spending on ‘new and upgrade’ capital projects is concentrated between 2022 and 2027, driven largely by the metro south-east corridor of the BRT. The review of the IPTN will direct where further corridors should be implemented based on several scenarios. It will also identify where incremental improvements should be made so that several public transport corridors can be implemented simultaneously. Together they will enable the realisation of the City’s spatial strategy in the long term.

## Road

The portfolio of road construction and upgrade projects will continue to provide relief from congestion, support major land development projects, and facilitate NMT.

Planned capital spending on ‘rehabilitation and refurbishment’ projects is concentrated in the period from 2024 to 2028. Most of these projects relate to road rehabilitation (49%) and metro road reconstruction (39%), which is in line with the Urban Mobility Directorate’s strategic objectives. Planned road rehabilitation projects are spread throughout the 10-year period, in line with the need to consistently address the road rehabilitation backlog. The planned metro road reconstruction projects are aimed at addressing the R450 million in backlogs noted in the Transport Sector Plan. The top five projects in terms of planned spending on rehabilitation are Broadlands Drive, Jakes Gerwel Drive, and roads in Simon’s Town, Delft and Swartklip.

There are a number of planned ‘new and upgrade’ capital projects over the next 10 years, which adequately account for the planned road expenditure programmes in the Transport Sector Plan.
