# Conclusion

The 2022 Infrastructure Report is the first consolidated attempt to evaluate the City’s infrastructure delivery plans across sectors for the next 10 years, taking into account the current status and future outlook. This first report was limited to evaluation of the City’s bulk infrastructure across the Energy, Urban Waste Management, Water and Sanitation, Human Settlements and Urban Mobility directorates only. It lays the foundation for future, deeper analysis across the City’s full infrastructure portfolio, including additional infrastructure typologies such as community facilities, reticulation and distribution infrastructure, environmental infrastructure, etc.

Future iterations of this report may also include other aspects, such as reviews of infrastructure requirements related to precincts or areas (location-based analysis) or on specific typologies of infrastructure (thematic- based analysis).

A key takeaway from the analysis of the portfolio is the importance of long-term or master planning and its role in informing efficient and effective long-term infrastructure planning. Adequate master planning should be prioritised across the City and should form the basis from which the integrated portfolio is developed in each of the City’s directorates.

This report also highlights the importance of prioritising project preparation resources for projects that have been identified as critical to meet future demand. The key risks identified across the five assessed directorates are as follows:

## Long-term capital pipeline deficiencies

An absence of planned capital projects in the outer years of the next 10-year horizon was noted in the Human Settlements and Urban Mobility directorates’ plans. This is the result of the reliance of these sectors on grant funding to finance projects, and is being addressed.

In terms of the Human Settlements Directorate:

* Capital expenditure on projects relating to top structures reduces by ± 75% after 2025, and continues reducing annually thereafter. This is reflective of the reliance of the City on grant and donation funding to finance the development of top structures.
* Spend on top structures will need to be replaced by spending on other typologies, with the City playing a different role, in order to meet housing demand over the next decade.

In terms of the Urban Mobility Directorate:

* There is a notable drop in planned capital expenditure after 2026 owing to the completion of the metro south-east corridor of the MyCiTi BRT.
  * This corresponds with a drop in grant and donation funding over the same period and will be addressed once the revised IPTN identifies the next priority corridors.
  * The absence of projects in the outer years needs to be addressed through the development of\
    a pipeline of capital projects.
* Public transport is a critical informant of the City’s MSDF, where transport-oriented development is the basis for land-use intensification, as well as in the IDP, where public transport is recognised as a key economic enabler. The updated Transport Sector Plan will inform an infrastructure investment pipeline in the face of significant unknowns relating to rail, grant funding and conventional bus services.

## The Philippi MTS

* The Eskom-owned Philippi MTS, which is critical to the security of supply to the City’s entire southern peninsula, is currently at 116% of firm capacity.
* The new Erica main transmission substation and the Philippi substation extension project are intended to address this over-firm capacity at the Philippi MTS. These projects are due to be completed in 2028 and 2026 respectively.
* The timely execution of these Eskom-led projects is critical to ensuring the security of supply to the area. The City continues to engage Eskom in\
  this regard.

## Solid waste rail access

* The location of the City’s regional transfer stations on the urban edge, and the design of these facilities, are aligned with the intention to utilise rail for the transport of waste.
* At present all of the city’s solid waste is transported via road as rail access is currently unavailable.
* This reliance on transport by trucks not only prevents regional transfer stations from meeting operational targets, but is costly and contributes to congestion and raising Cape Town’s carbon footprint.
* The City will continue to engage with Transnet to facilitate access to rail for the transport of solid waste to and from regional transfer stations.

## Regional landfill

* Current estimates are that the Coastal Park landfill will reach airspace capacity by 2024. While alternative disposal sites are available, making use of these would incur additional costs, thereby increasing the City’s operational expenditure.
* A regional landfill is therefore needed to manage current and future waste demands.
* The development of the regional landfill is dependent on EIA approval. Optimistic estimates put this approval process at 18 months from the date of submission, which was April 2022.
*   Procuring a regional landfill site and accelerating the EIA approval process are both critical to securing sufficient landfill airspace for the city.



## The BWAS

* The BWAS must continue to be prioritised.
* In the event that the Riviersonderend tunnel system fails, or is out of operation for an extended period of time, there is a risk that the city could lose approximately 40% to 50% of its water treatment capacity as well as its ability to access approximately 45% of its usable allocation of surface water resources.
* The BWAS is intended to mitigate the risk associated with the Riviersonderend tunnel system in addition to helping to meet thecity’s future water demand.
* Capital projects under the scheme relate to the Muldersvlei and Spes Bona reservoirs and associated tunnel systems.
* These projects are critical to mitigating associated risks and ensuring security of bulk water supply to the city.

## Stormwater master plans

* Stormwater master planning is seen as a priority in the Water and Sanitation Directorate.
* However, the completion of outstanding master plans is dependent on costs and available budgets. Unless additional budget can be secured, current estimates are that all the City’s master plans will only be completed by 2029.
* Additional budget should therefore be made available (or external funding secured) to accelerate the development of stormwater master plans.

## Declining passenger rail services

* Reliable passenger rail is considered the backbone of Cape Town’s public transport system, as indicated in the City’s IPTN and MSDF. The decline of passenger rail services in Cape Town places the city’s movement network at risk of inefficiencies and increasing congestion, as passengers move to alternative road-based forms of transport. While the City takes steps towards rail devolution in some form, there is a need to build out a complementary infrastructure pipeline.

The City’s ability to assess the current and future operational expenditure requirements linked to infrastructure operating and maintenance is less mature than its ability to analyse current and future capital requirements. In the face of fiscal constraints, operating expenditure requirements should be a key informant

in the City’s infrastructure investment decisions. This should be a key focus in future planning and reporting documents in order to provide a more comprehensive view of the City’s development, operation and management of infrastructure.

Understanding project dependencies within individual sectors, and between sectors, is critical to infrastructure planning. Existing ‘stage gate’ processes in the City identify critical dependencies within sector portfolios to ensure successful project progression and development.

Sector plans are a critical source of information and\
key reporting informants. The existing sector plans have been developed to varying levels of maturity, and efforts to improve these existing sector plans should be prioritised in order to ensure consistent planning quality.
