# Key Takeaways and Recommendations

* A sizable portion (38%) of the integrated portfolio relates to water and sanitation projects. Of these, 17,5% relate to the New Water Plan. The scope of the New Water Plan was conceptualised during the multi-year drought and was designed to provide an improved level of assurance of supply. While some of these projects contribute to alleviating existing capacity constraints in the City’s bulk water infrastructure network, a review of the approach to implementing the New Water Plan is being undertaken, primarily to confirm that the programme is still aligned to the City’s current investment priorities and risk tolerance (in light of climate change and pressure on consumers) and secondarily to assess the impact on affordability. Stemming from the New Water Plan, there are a number of projects planned for the next 10 years (see annexure C:9), which will diversify and augment the City’s water sources and provide redundancy in the system. This should mitigate risks in the event of future droughts.
* Current projections place the earliest completion of a BBF facility at 2028 (Cape Flats phase I, 2026 and phase II, 2028). In the interim, this positions the City as being non-compliant with relevant national legislative requirements for an extended period of time, and requires additional operational expenditure on alternative BBF management during a time of increasing fiscal constraints.
* Stormwater master planning needs to be prioritised by the Water and Sanitation Directorate. The absence of master plans will lead to delayed investment in infrastructure, which impacts on the City’s ability to mitigate flooding and adapt to climate change. Funding needs to be secured to accelerate the development of master plans that cover the entire city of Cape Town, so that appropriate projects can be captured in the portfolio.
