# Future Outlook

The City of Cape Town’s New Water Strategy (informed by the City’s New Water Plan) aims to secure 300 million litres of water per day, while saving approximately\
70 million litres of water per day by 2029. This will improve reliability of supply in the city from the current 98% to 99,5%. It will also improve the resilience of the city and will mitigate the risk of severe water restrictions being imposed in the future. Important aspects of the strategy are as follows:

* Investment into alternative water sources, including groundwater, wastewater reuse and desalination, to supplement the city’s existing water supply.
* The need for additional infrastructure to improve the flexibility and redundancy of the bulk water supply system.
* Capital projects included in the strategy have been revised to accommodate longer timeframes. However, these revisions still allow for the City to achieve the intended water supply by 2030 (see annexure C:9 for further details).

Figure 10 illustrates the City of Cape Town’s expected water demand based on the City’s Water Strategy.\
The Water Strategy was drafted prior to the Covid-19 pandemic and was based on the 2015 Water Master Plan. Despite the data being outdated, the directorate expects water demand to remain subdued until 2024. Thereafter, the city will experience growth

in demand while at the same time having to manage a reduction in the yield of the WCWSS. This will require integrated infrastructure to allow for a higher level of supply assurance and reduce the likelihood of severe water restrictions being imposed in the future.

Alongside this, significant focus is being placed, over the next 10 years, on expanding the City’s sanitation infrastructure to absorb new growth in households and businesses, and to transition Cape Town to a water-sensitive city with investments into catchments and stormwater infrastructure.

The Water and Sanitation Directorate plans to extend its capital spending increases up to 2026, dropping annually thereafter. The majority of planned capital projects (93%) relate to new and upgrade projects linked to the New Water Plan (alternative water sources, including groundwater, wastewater reuse and desalination, to supplement the city’s existing water supply) and the bulk water augmentation scheme (BWAS).

Planned investment in ‘refurbishment and replacement’ projects are fairly consistent over the coming 10-year period.

Almost all (99%) of the planned ‘refurbishment and replacement’ projects relate to bulk water infrastructure replacement as a result of the Water and Sanitation Directorate’s regular pipe replacement programme (informed by the Water and Sanitation Master Plan).

Of the projects under the New Water Plan, the following are likely to come online soonest, and once online will provide 46 MlD of water, hence contributing to the resilience of\
the water supply system towards the 99,5% assurance of supply target. See annexure C:9 for a full list of projects.

The BWAS aims to (a) meet peak growth in water demand and (b) mitigate significant risk to the security of water supply. The BWAS is a gravity scheme that can be fed from the Berg River Dam or from the Theewaterskloof Dam (see annexures C:10 and C:11 for further details). A total of 28% of new and upgrade projects in the next 10 years relate to the BWAS. This is in line with the City’s plans to improve security of bulk water supply.

## Bulk water reservoirs

In addition to existing constraints noted in the City’s bulk water reservoirs (see annexure C:13 for further details), rapid development in areas surrounding Zevenwacht (region 2) necessitates an additional reservoir to aid future development in this area and ensure water security. There are ‘new and upgrade’ projects planned for the Contermanskloof and Steenbras reservoirs, which will assist in alleviating capacity constraints to the City’s bulk water reservoirs.

## Pump stations

The rapid pump station condition assessment (as part of the MPP) covered over 50% of the City’s sewer pump stations, with the remainder currently being assessed. The assessment gave rise to the Priority Pump Station

Programme, which consists of a rolling list of 20 pump stations that will be upgraded in the future.

## Wastewater treatment works

Capacity upgrade projects are currently underway to address the constraints noted in the City’s WWTWs, specifically those in Athlone, Macassar, Potsdam and Zandvliet.

Planned refurbishment and replacement projects relating to the City’s WWTWs are focused in the five years between 2024 and 2028. This highlights the immediate maintenance needs of the City’s WWTWs in order to continue to treat water reliably into the future. However, the absence of planned refurbishment and replacement projects in the outer years (2029 to 2031) is concerning given the age of the City’s WWTWs infrastructure. In addition to existing treatment capacity constraints, the forecast growth in informality along with the extension of basic services will likely increase the load on the Borcherds Quarry facility. A second receiving WWTW will have to be designated to reduce the load on Borcherds Quarry.

**Infrastructure highlight: Faure New Water Scheme**

The Faure New Water Scheme (FNWS) is currently in the final stages of detailed design. It is a direct potable reuse scheme involving the purification of advanced treated effluent from Cape Town’s largest WWTWs, Zandvliet, to potable water standards. This is to augment the supply of water to Cape Town. The scheme has been designed to initially supply 70 million litres per day (MlD) of potable water, upgradable to 100 MlD. The aim is for this scheme to start delivering water to the city by 2028.

The FNWS will integrate with the existing Faure WTP, owned and operated by the City. The advanced purification plant will be located at the Faure WTP campus (referred to as zone 2 of the scheme) situated some 7 km away from the Zandvliet WWTW (referred to as zone 1), from where the source water (treated effluent) will be pumped via\
a rising main.

## Catchment and stormwater management

Forecast increases in the frequency and severity of major weather events put Cape Town at increased risk of flooding. This necessitates adequate stormwater master planning so that the City can develop appropriate infrastructure interventions in stormwater management. A programme has been developed to allow for the procurement of stormwater master plans for each catchment by 2029. This is subject to the availability\
of appropriate funds.

The lack of sufficient stormwater master planning makes it challenging to present an adequate future analysis of infrastructure requirements. However, there are a number of flooding management and pollution abatement projects on the 10-year horizon that will positively impact on the Diep River, Kuils River, Lourens River, Soet River, Vygiekraal River, Spaanschemat River, and Prinskasteel River.
