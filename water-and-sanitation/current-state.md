# Current State

## Bulk water and reticulation network and reservoirs

The City’s bulk water network is made up of a total of 658 435 km of pipelines, with 24 reservoirs and 35 pump stations. While approximately 11 012 km of water pipes, 154 reticulation reservoirs/tanks (including disused) and 120 water pump stations (including boosters) make up the City’s water reticulation network. An assessment is currently under way to identify the upgrade and refurbishment requirements of the City’s bulk and reticulation water reservoirs. In the interim, the following have been noted:

* Bulk storage capacity is sufficient to meet the city’s water demands throughout the week.&#x20;
* A total of 19 of the City’s reticulation reservoirs experience capacity constraints as they have less than 48 hours of storage capacity for their distribution areas (see annexure C:1 for further details).
* A total of four of the City’s bulk water reservoirs, Blackheath Upper, Wynberg No. 2, Monterey and Constantia Nek, experience capacity constraints with a significant reduction in water levels during peak usage. This indicates insufficient redundant capacity.
* Concerns have been noted at the Brakkloof reservoir, which ensures security of supply to the so- called ‘Deep South’ (Muizenberg to Simon’s Town). This area is supplied by a single distribution pipeline and, in the event of a prolonged water outage due to required repairs, it will not have sufficient storage to secure supply for the duration of the repair.

## Bulk supply conveyance

The majority of the pipelines in the City’s bulk supply system have flow velocities within acceptable limits. However, regions one to four (see figure 7 overleaf) contain lengths of bulk pipelines that are noted as having capacity constraints (see annexures C:2 and C:3 for further details).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Water flow velocities** in water systems should not exceed certain limits, to avoid noise and prevent wear and tear of pipes and fittings.

## Water treatment plants

The City’s 12 water treatment plants have a total design capacity of 1 655 Ml/d. However, actual usable peak capacity is about 1 422 Ml/d due to the age of the infrastructure and other constraints. These constraints will be factored into the Bulk Water master plan as well as the timing and phasing of future infrastructure builds and upgrades. The master plan will include a plan for how these water treatment plants are going to be returned to full capacity.

The following capacity constraints and risks are noted with regard to the City’s water treatment plants (see annexure C:4 for further details):



* A total of five water treatment plants currently have no surplus capacity during peak demand.
* The Voëlvlei and Wemmershoek water treatment plants cannot shut down for extended periods due to capacity constraints, meaning that much-needed routine maintenance activities cannot be carried out.
* The Blackheath and Faure water treatment plants are fed directly from Theewaterskloof Dam via the Riviersonderend tunnel system. In the event of the tunnel failing, or being out of operation for extended periods, the City would lose approximately 40% to 50% of its water treatment capacity as well as the ability to access approximately 45% of its current usable allocation of surface water resources.

## Wastewater treatment works

Land-based WWTWs are designed for a certain flow and pollution load capacity. The designed pollution load capacity (the ability to treat wastewater flow and nutrients such as COD, nitrogen, and phosphorus) is the critical factor that determines the need for a capacity upgrade. WWTWs compliance with national licence conditions, regarding the quality of effluent, at these facilities has declined from 90% to 80% over the last 10 years, due

to ageing infrastructure and capacity constraints. When a WWTWs experiences 90% or more of its hydraulic flow and load, the implementation of an upgrade is triggered; if 100% load is reached, then it is considered over capacity.

The following capacity constraints are noted:

* The Potsdam, Zandvliet, Klipheuwel and Macassar facilities have either flow or load capacity constraints (see annexure C:5 for further details).
* The Borcherds Quarry WWTWs is the only facility that can accept delivery of tankered faecal sludge and chemical toilet waste from informal settlements.

{% hint style="info" %}
WWTWs are designed to accommodate a hydraulic or **flow capacity**, which is a specific volume of wastewater per day in order to be able to treat a specific nutrient **load capacity** (organic, nitrogen and phosphorus load – in essence, the pollution load contained in the wastewater).

Wastewater sludge treatment: Cape Town produces two types of wastewater sludge: waste-activated sludge (approximately 150 tonnes/day) and primary sludge, which is classed as a hazardous waste (about 50 tonnes/ day). Each sludge type requires a different disposal approach:

* Waste-activated sludge is disposed of to agricultural land as soil conditioner/fertiliser, as per applicable legislation.
* Hazardous primary and waste-activated sludge cake is collected, transported, and disposed of by private contractors at a hazardous landfill site.
* National legislation, effective from 2019, prohibits the disposal of liquid to landfills, with organic diversion from landfill partially prohibited by 2023 and totally prohibited by 2027.

In anticipation of this legislation, three bio-solid beneficiation facilities (BBFs) are planned in order to treat and beneficiate the bio-solids to Class A1a (safe for distribution to all agriculture and public facilities as soil conditioner and fertiliser) to enable a much larger range of disposal options and divert primary sludge from landfill. However, to date, none of these facilities have been completed\
(see annexure C:6 for further details).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Wastewater sludge** is the residual, semi-solid material that is produced as a byproduct during sewage treatment of industrial or municipal wastewater.

## Bulk sewer and pump stations

Cape Town has 487 sewerage pump stations and\
9 615 km of sewerage network. A package of work has been developed by the City as part of the MPP, with the objective of reducing the frequency, duration and impact of sewage spills, and improving the response time to address spillages. As part of this, a conditional assessment of pump stations was undertaken by the City, which noted the following:

* In areas of high density and increasing informality, frequent blocking of sewers with foreign objects resulted in sewer spills.
* A total of 25 of the City’s pump stations have insufficient capacity (see annexure C:7 for further details).
* The Rietvlei pump station, upstream of the Bellville WWTWs, requires upgrading of its rising main and gravity system14 to accommodate developments in the Bellville WWTWs catchment. This project will take approximately three to four years to complete.

Challenges to maintenance in the sewerage reticulation network are mainly due to the following:

* The age of pump station infrastructure (e.g. replacement parts no longer available)
* Abuse of the sewer network through vandalism and the disposal of foreign objects
* Delayed maintenance
* Low rate of pipe replacement
* Lack of capacity in parts of the network&#x20;
* Load-shedding

## Catchment stormwater and river management

Catchment and stormwater management infrastructure is vital to address public safety and improve the water quality in Cape Town’s waterways. Each of the City’s 21 catchments requires its own stormwater master plan

to effectively manage flooding, pollution and inform the Water and Sanitation Directorate’s capital planning needs into the future. The following have been noted with regard to the City’s stormwater master plans:

* To date, only 10 high-level master plans, covering 50% of the city, have been developed.
* The completion of the remaining master plans is dependent on available funding. A programme has been developed to allow for the procurement of stormwater master plans for each catchment by 2029.
* The lack of adequate stormwater master plans poses a risk to the City’s ability to effectively manage stormwater for flood protection and water harvesting (see annexure C:8 for further details).
* The quality of the data relating to the City’s stormwater infrastructure is insufficient. This presents a challenge in terms of assessing the state of this infrastructure. Only the Elsieskraal River catchment stormwater drainage system status is presented in the sector plan and it is thus the only area covered in this report.
* The catchment area’s bulk minor stormwater drainage system (600 mm diameter and above) is noted as being under pressure.

Approximately 78,4% of the underground drainage system presents a high risk to water quality in the catchment as the system conveys illicit polluted discharges to the rivers. Illicit discharges include flow from informal settlements, backyarder dwellings, sewer reticulation and pump station spills that occur either directly into the stormwater system or are transported there via roads.
