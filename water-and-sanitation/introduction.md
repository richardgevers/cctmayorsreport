# Introduction

**The City is responsible for the reticulation, treatment and provision of water to residents of Cape Town, while National Government, through the Department of Water and Sanitation, is responsible for bulk water supply and infrastructure. Cape Town is part of the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS), which gets its water from six major rain-fed dams.**

The City is also responsible for the provision of sanitation services in the metro. This includes developing and maintaining an extensive network of sewers and\
pump stations to safely pipe wastewater to the City’s wastewater treatment works.

Securing a reliable supply of water in the future, and providing quality sanitation and refuse collection services, are essential to enable a life of hope and dignity for communities, as well as to support Cape Town’s businesses and most essential industries.

Consistent management and maintenance of the City’s stormwater system are also critical for managing flood risks, improving inland water quality and optimising the harvesting of stormwater as a valuable water resource.

The City’s water and sanitation bulk infrastructure thus consists of a complex and integrated network. For the purposes of this report, bulk supply reservoirs, bulk supply conveyance, water treatment plants, wastewater treatment works, sewerage pump stations, wastewater reticulation and stormwater catchment infrastructure are considered.

The Mayor’s Sanitation and Inland Water Quality Programme will have a direct impact on the future infrastructure plans of the Water and Sanitation Directorate. These projects were not captured in the infrastructure plans of the directorate at the time of writing this report, but will be included in future reports.
